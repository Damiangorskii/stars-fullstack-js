# Stars Dictionary App

âœ¨

Welcome to the Stars Dictionary App! ðŸŒŒ This full-stack application allows users to explore and manage information about stars, creating their own celestial dictionary.

## Overview

The Stars Dictionary App provides a RESTful API for interacting with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve information about various stars, including the ability to upload images. On the frontend, users can view, add, update, and delete stars from their personal celestial journal, with a responsive UI built using Bootstrap.

## Backend Stack

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, including middleware for handling file uploads like `multer`.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing star-related data.
- **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **Nodemon:** A utility that monitors for changes in files and automatically restarts the server.

### Project Structure

The backend follows a modular structure, with key components:

- **`server.js`:** The main entry point for the Express server.
- **`models/star.js`:** Defines the Mongoose model for stars, including image paths.
- **`routes/stars.js`:** Handles RESTful API routes for star-related operations, including image uploads.
- **`app.js`:** Configures the MongoDB connection and middleware.

### Getting Started with the Backend

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `nodemon server.js`
3. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Make sure you have created `uploads` catalogue inside `Backend` catalogue

## Frontend Stack

### Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
- **React Router:** A library for handling navigation in a React application.
- **Bootstrap:** A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **Styled Components:** For additional styling of React components with tagged template literals.

### Project Structure

The frontend is organized into components and follows a container-presentation pattern:

- **`src/components/`:** Reusable UI components, including forms for uploading images.

### Getting Started with the Frontend

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm start`
3. Open the app at `http://localhost:3000`
